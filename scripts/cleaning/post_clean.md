## This report is based on the cleaned dataset of diabetic_data.csv

Some changes have been made to the raw dataset.  

1. 'weight' & 'payer_code' columns have been removed
2. All string values have been converted into an integer value

These changes were necessary in order to to use the information at a later date for statistical analysis.
